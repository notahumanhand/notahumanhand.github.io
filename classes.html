                <h2>Scoundrel</h2>
                <p>Being a scoundrel doesnâ€™t always mean being a criminal, though the overlap between the two is considerable. However, where many criminals prefer to work alone, many scoundrels tend towards having a team, who can have expertise in something they themself do not. A scoundrel is an expert in their own set of skills, of course, too - whether that be connections, nimble hands, or good old-fashioned stabbing. 
                    <br>Upon choosing Scoundrel as your class, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                <h4>Primary Class Bonus</h4>

                <p>You know where to strike to make your attacks hurt. When you make an attack with a weapon with the Finesse or Ranged property, and you have an ally within 5 feet of the target or have advantage on your roll against the target, you may add an additional 1d8 damage on a hit. This damage increases by an additional 1d8 at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20.</p>#
